I am a PhD Student at the Quantitative Biology Center in Tuebingen, Germany. I spent most of my time developing [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek) and contributing to the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) project. I am also involved in several data analysis projects revolving around variant analysis in oncology. Since November 2022, I am the deputy team leader for the research and development group.
